ggraph1.f   is a Fortran file which is a modified version of ggraph.f
            in the bundle.  This version generates networks with 
            capacities and costs in [1, MAXCAP].  (The original version
            generates capacities in [0, MAXCAP] -- the netflo solver
            doesn't work with zero capacities.)
