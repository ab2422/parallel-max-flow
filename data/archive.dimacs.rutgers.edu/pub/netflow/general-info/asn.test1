This file describes an experiment for assignment problem suggested by 
Peter Shor.   

The original instances represent random points in the plane.  Half are
red and half are blue.  From these random points a bipartite network 
is constructed which contains all red-to-blue edges.  Edge costs are
Euclidean distances between the vertices, truncated to an integer.  

To perform this experiment, you'll need the following files:

   pub/netflow/generators/matching/dcube.c  : A c program to generate 
                                              geometric instances.

   pub/netflow/generators/geomasn.a         : An Awk program to convert 
                                              geometric to bipartite networks
                                              in .asn format.

1)Compile dcube.c.    cc dcube.c -lm -o dcube 
2)The program dcube accepts commands on its standard input and generates
  the graph on standard output.  Use the following commands, with settings
  described below. (See the code for descriptions of other commands that
  you may wish to use.) 

    nodes N   
    maxloc L

   N  : Generate problem sizes in powers of 2, as described in the 
         Core Experiment document.
 
   L  : Maximum value of the x and y coordinates.  Generate 2 classes
         of graphs:

         +Assign-Geom-LoCost:  Set L = 10^4
  
         +Assign-Geom-HiCost:  Set L = 10^6

3)  The awk program geomasm.a converts geometric files to bipartite
    networks for the assignment problem.  To use it, type

      awk -f geomasn.a <test.geom >test.asn
