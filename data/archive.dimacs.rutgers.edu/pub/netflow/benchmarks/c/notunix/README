-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Match_C.shell file contains a program, written in C, for finding 
MAXIMUM-WEIGHT MATCHING for UNDIRECTED graphs.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was written by Ed Rothberg to implement H. Gabow's N-cubed 
weighted matching algorithm, as described in his Ph.D. thesis 
"Implementation of Algorithms for Maximum Matching on Nonbipartite Graphs" 
Stanford University, 1973.  


MAIN PROGRAMS:
		- wmatch

REQUIRED FILES:
		README input.form output.form makefile graphtypes.h glib.c pairs.c
		term.c pointer.c readgraph.c unpairs.c match.defs wmatch.c main.c

TO GET THESE FILES:
        Run the "Match_C.shell" file in the /bin/sh shell. 
		(It will unwrap itself.)

FILE DESCRIPTIONS: 
		input.form:  Describes the input formats for match.
		output.form: Describes output formats for match.
						***Format converters will be available soon to
						translate input and output files from and to the
						DIMACS Challenge format. Contributions are welcome. 
		
		test.in:  A sample input for wmatch
		
        The others are source code files written in C language.

HOW TO MAKE THE PROBLEM-SOLVERS:

		wmatch:  Solves maximum matching for undirected graphs presented in an 
		       adjacency-list format. 

		       Requires:graphtypes.h glib.c pairs.c term.c pointer.c 
						readgraph.c unpairs.c match.defs wmatch.c main.c makefile 
 
		
		       To compile: $make
		       To invoke: $wmatch input_file
		
		      If no filename is given, a small help message appears. It always  
		      writes to standard out.  

/ This README file was written by DIMACS, and based on experiments with the
codes. /
