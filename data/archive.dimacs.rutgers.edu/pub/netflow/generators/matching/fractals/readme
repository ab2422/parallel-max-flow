FRACTALS --- This directory contains programs and examples for producing
      random point sets which converge to fractal images. 

fractals.c:  The generation program. It accepts an input file on standard
      in and writes to standard out.  Read code comments for more info. 
      The max coordinate value is 1000000, but the max seen in output
      will depend on the input file.  

*.in      :  Sample input files.
