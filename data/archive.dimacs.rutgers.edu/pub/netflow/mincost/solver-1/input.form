The following input description is from Helgasen and Kennington's User
Manual. NETFLO.INP contains an example input instance. 

   There are four sets of information that are specified in the input: the
number of nodes for the problem; the non-zero requirements at nodes; the
number of arcs incident to each node; the arc name, from node, to node, 
cost, upper bound and lower bound for each arc.

   Since NETFLO is an all-integer code, the input is all integer.  The input
format used for all data is 8I10.  That is, eight fields for 10-digit 
integers.  The only type of data which requires all eight fields is the 
specification of the number of arcs incident to each node.
  
   The input consists of:

(1) The number of nodes.  The number of nodes in the problem is the first
     data item.  It is given on the first field of the first line of data. 

(2) The non-zero requirements at nodes.  It is only necesary to specify the
    requirements for nodes which have non-zero requirements.  For each node,
    one line of data is used to specify the node number and the requirement.
    In NETFLO, supply at a node is assumed to be a positive requirement and 
    demand at a node is assumed to be a negative requirement. To indicate the
    end of specification of requirements, a blank line is used.

(3) The number of arcs incident to each node.  This data is used to reserve
    locations in the arc-length arrays for arcs to each of the nodes 
    1,2,...n.  If there are 85 nodes in a problem, then 11 lines of data are
    required.  The first 10 lines have all eight fields occupied and line 11 
    of this type has only five field occupied.

(4) Arc data: arc name, from-node, to-node, cost, upper bound and lower bound.
    For each arc, one line provides the six items of data. The arc name is an
    integer.  In this version, if the upper bound on an arc is 0 or blank, 
    then NETFLO interprets the arc to be unbounded.  If the input value of
    the upper bound is -1, then NETFLO interprets the arc to have an upper 
    bound of 0.  The last line of this set of data must be a blank line.

    The preferred manner of arranging the arc data is to have all arcs incident
to node 1 appear first, then all arcs incident to node 2, ..., and finally all
arcs incident to node n.  This manner of arranging the arcs is referred to as
backward star format. Of course, there may be no arcs incident to some of the
nodes.  Even if the arc data is not in backward star and even if the number of 
arcs incident to each node is incorrectly specified in the third set of input
data, NETFLO recovers from the error and makes the necessary changes.  
Naturally, the changes require additonal processing to reorder the arcs as
required by the program.  


To convert input files from DIMACS min format to NETFLO format:
--------------------------------------------------------------
		Use the Unix shell program min_to_flo.

		Usage: min_to_flo input.min NETFLO.INP
	
		(This program needs two other awk-source files:
				trans.a format.a)
