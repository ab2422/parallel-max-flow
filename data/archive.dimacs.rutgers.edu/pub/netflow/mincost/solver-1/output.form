From the User's Manual:
   
   [Output files first contain a complete listing of the input. File
    NETFLO.OUT contains an example output file.]

   NETFLO automatically introduces slac arcs when the total supply exceeds
total demand .... Slack flows are output separately from the input arcs.  
If total supply equals total demand, then the slack flow information is 
not included.  However, when total demand exceed total supply (before or 
after the adjustment of flows due to lower bounds) the problem is declared 
infeasible. 

   NETFLO terminates either due to inconsistency in the input data or by 
determining that the problem is infeasible, or by producing the optimal 
solution.  There are two STOP (STOP 77777 and STOP 12345) statements which
effect termination.  If infeasibility is due to negative net requirements, 
then termination occurs during input processing. Otherwise, infeasibility 
can be caused by insufficient capacity in the network to allow shipment from 
supply nodes to demand nodes. 

To convert output files from NETFLO to DIMACS standard:
------------------------------------------------------
		Use the Unix shell program flo_to_std.

		Usage: flo_to_std NETFLO.OUT Outfile
	
		(This program needs two other awk-source files:
				flo_to_std.a del_dup.a )
