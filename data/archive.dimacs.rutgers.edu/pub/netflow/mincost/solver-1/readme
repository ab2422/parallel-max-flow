-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NETFLOW_F.shell file contains programs and files relating to the NETFLO
program written by R. V. Helgason and J. L. Kennington in 1976.

Programming'' by Kennington and Helgason, John Wiley, 1980.


REQUIRED FILES:
        readme input.form output.form NETFLO.INP NETFLO.OUT NETFLO.FOR
		netflo.f min_to_flo flo_to_std format.a trans.a 
                flo_to_std.a del_dup.a

TO GET THESE FILES:
        Run the "NETFLOW_F.shell" file in the /bin/sh shell. 
		(It will unwrap itself.)
		Or copy the files themselves.

ANOTHER FILE: 
        netrans.tar.Z:  contains C source code for programs to convert
                 between DIMACS and netflow.f formats.  These programs
                 are more efficient than the awk programs provided
                 in the above shell script, and should be used for large
                 instances.  Use the Unix ``tar'' command to unbundle
                 these files.  Contributed by Geraldo Viega
                    ilan34@violet.berkeley.edu

FILE DESCRIPTIONS: 
		input.form:  A description of the NETFLO input format, taken from the
		               user guide. Usage of the input format converter. 

		output.form:   A description of the NETFLO output format, from the user
		               guide. Usage of the output format converter.

		NETFLO.INP:    The required name of the input file. Contains a sample
		               input file.  

		NETFLO.OUT:    The output file. This file will be created (and overwritten)
		               by the program at each invocation. 
		
		NETFLO.FOR:    The original NENETFLO.FORTFLO code, compatible with IBM PC running
		               under Microsoft FORTRAN Optimizing Compiler.  The output
		               appears in file 6. 

		netflo.f  :    Code modified for compatibility with Unix. See program 
		               header.  To compile:   f77 netflo.f -o netflo
